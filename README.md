To run the code, perform the following steps:

1. Hope and pray for the day that I do put out code here
2. If code appears, run code

Following these steps will lead to an infinite recursion loop, due to the "run code" part on the second step leading back to the first step for running the code. Enjoy!

Signing off. :)
